# Virtual Turing Machine - A React based Turing machine playground

## About

A Turing machine app virtualized/visualized with React.js. Features an editor menu and a display component with the necessary controls for configuring and visualizing turing machines. Still working on minor issues and important shit like an infinite (or big and looped) tape and symbol set configs.
