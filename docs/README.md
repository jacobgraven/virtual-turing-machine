# Virtual Turing Machine - A React based Turing machine playground

## About

## Setup Instructions

If you would like to test the project on your device, follow the instructions below.

### Software Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - Node.js
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) - Node.js package manager
  - A package manager like Yarn or pnpm should also work

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jacobgraven/virtual-turing-machine.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory

```bash
cd virtual-turing-machine
```

3. Install the dependencies with your package manager

```bash
npm install
```

If you are using a different package manager, use the appropriate command:

```bash
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

### Running the Project

To start the project on your local machine, use the start command:

```bash
npm start
# yarn start
```

The app should be available at https://localhost:3000. Your default browser should automatically open the page.

#### If the app does not automatically open on your browser and the URL 'https://localhost:3000' is not working, you likely have problems with your local environment. I have only used npm on this project so I am not sure if a different package manager presents any problems. I plan to deploy the project to a dedicated domain so installation is not necessary to use it.
